# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the main changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

**What do I do here?**

This folder is used by the changesets tool to track version bumps. Each changeset is a markdown file
describing the changes being made and the type of version bump (major/minor/patch).

Before submitting a PR, run `pnpm changeset` to generate a changeset file describing your changes.
